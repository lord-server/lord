-- Translations^

--- is a simple wrapper around
---   `minetest.translate`, and `minetest.get_translator(textdomain)(str, ...)` is
---   equivalent to `minetest.translate(textdomain, str, ...)`.
---   It is intended to be used in the following way, so that it avoids verbose
---   repetitions of `minetest.translate`:
---
---   local S = minetest.get_translator(textdomain)
---   S(str, ...)
---
---   As an extra commodity, if `textdomain` is nil, it is assumed to be "" instead.
---
--- [View in lua_api.txt](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/5.4.1/doc/lua_api.txt#L3329-L3338)
---
--- @param text_domain string
--- @return fun(str: string, ...)
function minetest.get_translator(text_domain) end
--- translates the string `str` with
---   the given `textdomain` for disambiguation. The textdomain must match the
---   textdomain specified in the translation file in order to get the string
---   translated. This can be used so that a string is translated differently in
---   different contexts.
---   It is advised to use the name of the mod as textdomain whenever possible, to
---   avoid clashes with other mods.
---   This function must be given a number of arguments equal to the number of
---   arguments the translated string expects.
---   Arguments are literal strings -- they will not be translated, so if you want
---   them to be, they need to come as outputs of `minetest.translate` as well.
---
---   For instance, suppose we want to translate "@1 Wool" with "@1" being replaced
---   by the translation of "Red". We can do the following:
---
---   local S = minetest.get_translator()
---   S("@1 Wool", S("Red"))
---
---   This will be displayed as "Red Wool" on old clients and on clients that do
---   not have localization enabled. However, if we have for instance a translation
---   file named `wool.fr.tr` containing the following:
---
---   @1 Wool=Laine @1
---   Red=Rouge
---
---   this will be displayed as "Laine Rouge" on clients with a French locale.

--- * Fields are sent for formspec elements which define a field. `fields`
---   is a table containing each formspecs element value (as string), with
---   the `name` parameter as index for each. The value depends on the
---   formspec element type:
---     * `animated_image`: Returns the index of the current frame.
---     * `button` and variants: If pressed, contains the user-facing button
---       text as value. If not pressed, is `nil`
---     * `field`, `textarea` and variants: Text in the field
---     * `dropdown`: Either the index or value, depending on the `index event`
---       dropdown argument.
---     * `tabheader`: Tab index, starting with `"1"` (only if tab changed)
---     * `checkbox`: `"true"` if checked, `"false"` if unchecked

---     * `table`: See `minetest.explode_table_event`
---     * `scrollbar`: See `minetest.explode_scrollbar_event`
---     * Special case: `["quit"]="true"` is sent when the user actively
---       closed the form by mouse click, keypress or through a button_exit[]
---       element.
---     * Special case: `["key_enter"]="true"` is sent when the user pressed
---       the Enter key and the focus was either nowhere (causing the formspec
---       to be closed) or on a button. If the focus was on a text field,
---       additionally, the index `key_enter_field` contains the name of the

--- * e.g. `minetest.bulk_set_node({{x=0, y=1, z=1}, {x=1, y=2, z=2}}, {name="default:stone"})`
--- * For node specification or position syntax see `minetest.set_node` call
--- * Faster than set_node due to single call, but still considerably slower
---   than Lua Voxel Manipulators (LVM) for large numbers of nodes.
---   Unlike LVMs, this will call node callbacks. It also allows setting nodes
---   in spread out positions which would cause LVMs to waste memory.
---   For setting a cube, this is 1.3x faster than set_node whereas LVM is 20
---   times faster.

---       and `prob`.
---         * `pos` is the 3D vector specifying the absolute coordinates of the
---           node being modified,
---         * `prob` is an integer value from `0` to `255` that encodes
---           probability and per-node force-place. Probability has levels
---           0-127, then 128 may be added to encode per-node force-place.
---           For probability stated as 0-255, divide by 2 and round down to
---           get values 0-127, then add 128 to apply per-node force-place.
---         * If there are two or more entries with the same pos value, the
---           last entry is used.
---         * If `pos` is not inside the box formed by `p1` and `p2`, it is
---           ignored.
---         * If `probability_list` equals `nil`, no probabilities are applied.
--- * Apply the specified probability to the specified horizontal slices
---   according to the `slice_prob_list`.
---     * `slice_prob_list` is an array of tables containing two fields, `ypos`
---       and `prob`.
---         * `ypos` indicates the y position of the slice with a probability
---           applied, the lowest slice being `ypos = 0`.
---         * If slice probability list equals `nil`, no slice probabilities
---           are applied.

--- * If the `rotation` parameter is omitted, the schematic is not rotated.
--- * `replacements` = `{["old_name"] = "convert_to", ...}`
--- * `force_placement` is a boolean indicating whether nodes other than `air`
---   and `ignore` are replaced by the schematic.
--- * Returns nil if the schematic could not be loaded.

--- * All corners and edges of the defined volume are checked.
--- * `interval` defaults to 4.
--- * `interval` should be carefully chosen and maximised to avoid an excessive
---   number of points being checked.
--- * Like `minetest.is_protected`, this function may be extended or
---   overwritten by mods to provide a faster implementation to check the
---   cuboid for intersections.

--- * Attempt to predict the desired orientation of the facedir-capable node
---   defined by `itemstack`, and place it accordingly (on-wall, on the floor,
---   or hanging from the ceiling).
--- * `infinitestacks`: if `true`, the itemstack is not changed. Otherwise the
---   stacks are handled normally.
--- * `orient_flags`: Optional table containing extra tweaks to the placement code:
---     * `invert_wall`:   if `true`, place wall-orientation on the ground and
---       ground-orientation on the wall.
---     * `force_wall` :   if `true`, always place the node in wall orientation.
---     * `force_ceiling`: if `true`, always place on the ceiling.
---     * `force_floor`:   if `true`, always place the node on the floor.
---     * `force_facedir`: if `true`, forcefully reset the facedir to north
---       when placing on the floor or ceiling.
---     * The first four options are mutually-exclusive; the last in the list
---       takes precedence over the first.
--- * `prevent_after_place` is directly passed to `minetest.item_place_node`
--- * Returns the new itemstack after placement

--- * Returns the amount of knockback applied on the punched player.
--- * Arguments are equivalent to `register_on_punchplayer`, except the following:
---     * `distance`: distance between puncher and punched player
--- * This function can be overriden by mods that wish to modify this behaviour.
--- * You may want to cache and call the old function to allow multiple mods to
---   change knockback behaviour.

---   (not saved between server runs).
