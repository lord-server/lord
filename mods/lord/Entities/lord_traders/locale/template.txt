We have many treasures, and for the right price we might be willing to part with them...=
Don't even think of stealing our treasure... If you do, heads shall roll.=
What are you doing here? What do you want from us?=
Be careful when you enter our homes, a fall from the ladder could well prove deadly.=
If you want to mine, do so. There's plenty of iron to go around!=
If you venture deep underground, beware! The monsters there are very powerful, and kill the unprepared instantly.=
Welcome to our lovely forest home, weary traveler. Refresh yourself here.=
Sauron grows in power. Shall we be able to vanquish him again?=
We are a peace loving people, but if we are angered, our wrath is terrible!=
Rest among us and prepare yourself, for war is imminent.=
If you wish to buy goods from us, there are certain traders who wander our land.=
Beware! Our society, and all societies, are on the edge of a knife blade - one false move and all will end, and Sauron will rule supreme.=
Ah, what a lovely land we have, so peaceful, so beautiful.=
There's nothing quite like the smell of pipe smoke rising on a cold October morning, is there?=
If you are in need of any food, there are traders who wander around and they usually have a good stock.=
If you are thinking that you'll find adventures here, think again! Good day!=
We hear tales of war, but they cannot be more than tales - like that of the Oliphaunt.=
Food is meant to be enjoyed, not rushed. Don't just eat a little here and a little there, sit down for a proper meal sometimes...=
War comes swiftly... We are preparing, but are we doing enough?=
The noble race of man rises in the world! Even the dwarves are starting to show interest in some of our goods.=
Are you willing to fight with us? We have much to lose, but much to gain also! We must rally together.=
Don't listen to those who say that all this talk of war will come to nothing, for we are at war now.=
We suffer raids from orcs, and other evil things, yet we do nothing! We must act, and act with force!=
Life here is far from normal. We wish for peace, yet the only way we can get peace is through war...=
DIE!!!, Urrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!=
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!, KILL! KILL! KILL!=
