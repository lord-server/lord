	"a single, cohesive new material, certain\\\nchanges take place, not only in " ..
	"their physical\\\nstructure but also in their capabilities and uses.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Having spent many years working on these\\\nconcepts, with the help and guidance " ..
	"of Annatar,\\\nthe kindly lord of gifts, we, the elves, have come to\\\na great " ..
	"understanding of these matters, in regards\\\nto a few, particular materials. " ..
	"From this knowledge,\\\nwe have been able to devise objects of great\\\npower, " ..
	"unknown to our land until this time, objects\\\nwhich have been seen only " ..
	"among the Valar.\\\nOur knowledge concerns, in particular, gold, silver,\\\n" ..
	"and gems, fashioned into the form of rings.  So that\\\nthis knowledge might " ..
	"be passed on to the future\\\nand to posterity, I have determined that it is\\\n" ..
	"necessary for me to write about  the process\\\nthrough which these objects are " ..
	"made.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nRINGSILVER\\\n" ..
	"---------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n" ..
	"The first steps involve the preparation of ringsilver,\\\nout of which the " ..
	"ring is formed. First, normal ingots\\\nof gold and silver, which even the " ..
	"dwarves\\\nconsider to be pure, must be taken, and purified\\\nfurther, so " ..
	"that there are no impurities left in them.\\\nThis is done simply by heating " ..
	"a gold or silver\\\ningot over a normal fire, and leaving it there for a\\\n" ..
	"longer time. After this, the two pure ingots must be\\\nheated up, and " ..
	"combined into goldsilver, in a\\\nfurnace like that used for bronze, made " ..
	"of a normal\\\nfurnace, with iron above, and to both sides of it.\\\nAfter " ..
	"several goldsilver ingots have been made,\\\nthey can be smelted, in a " ..
	"special furnace with\\\nmithril, over a fire which has had rough rock added\\\n" ..
	"to it. This furnace is made by surrounding a normal\\\nfurnace in obsidian, " ..
	"so as to prevent it from setting\\\nnearby things on fire. When the ringsilver " ..
	"has been\\\ncooked, it will appear on top of the furnace,\\\npropelled out by " ..
	"the force of the blast which\\\nhappens when the materials combine. \\\n\\\n" ..
	"The ringsilver will be very hot, and must be cooled\\\ndown in natural " ..
	"seawater, within ten seconds, in\\\norder for it to form the correct structure. " ..
	"Then, you\\\nhave ringsilver, the basis of the ring!" ..
	"\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nRINGS\\\n" ..
	"----------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n" ..
	"Out of the ringsilver, you can then form a ring. This\\\nis not easy, " ..
	"despite sounding so. The ring formed\\\nmust be perfect in shape, and therefore, " ..
	"cannot be\\\nformed in one step.\\\n\\\nFirst, two ingots of ringsilver must be " ..
	"taken, and\\\nplaced together in the dual furnace, which was\\\nused to combine " ..
	"the gold and silver earlier. Then,\\\nthe ingots will fuse together, forming a " ..
	"quarter of a\\\nring. However, they may not form in the correct\\\nshape, and " ..
	"will melt in the ashes of the fire. When\\\ntwo of these have been obtained, " ..
	"they must be\\\nsmelted in a fire, in order to obtain a half ring.\\\nAgain, " ..
	"the join between these two pieces may be\\\nimperfect, and so will be discarded. " ..
	"When two half\\\nrings have been obtained, they must be smelted,\\\nagain, with " ..
	"the chance of failure, to produce a\\\nwhole ring.\\\n\\\nAfter the ring has " ..
	"been made, it must be prepared\\\nin order that a gem might be set in it. " ..
	"First, two pins\\\nmust be crafted out of ringsilver, one ingot of which\\\n " ..
	"produces both pins necessary, and then, the pins\\\nmust be added to the ring, " ..
	"one above and to the\\\nleft, the other above and two the right.\\\n\\\nAfter " ..
	"this has been done, the ring is ready to be\\\ncombined with the gem, the " ..
	"preparation of which\\\nI shall now discuss." ..
	"\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nGEMS\\\n" ..
	"----------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n" ..
	"In the depths of the earth, certain gems of various\\\ncolours can be found. " ..
	"These gems require a\\\ncomplex process, fraught with the risk of them\\\n" ..
	"breaking, before they can be added to the ring.\\\n\\\nEven the first step of" ..
	"mining these gems out is not\\\neasy. Normal pickaxes cannot dig them, because" ..
	"\\\nthe stone in which they are encased is so hard.\\\nA mithril pickaxe is " ..
	"required, but it must also have\\\nrough rock added to it, in order to give it " ..
	"some\\\nchance of having the gems survive the mining\\\nprocess. Three rough " ..
	"rock should be placed\\\nabove a mithril pickaxe, one directly above, one to" ..
	"\\\nthe left, one to the right. Even with this pickaxe, it is\\\nstill rare to " ..
	"obtain a gem from the ore.\\\n\\\nWhen you have obtained several gems, and you" ..
	"\\\nmust have several, for you will not complete the\\\nprocess without breaking " ..
	"some, you can begin on\\\nthe next stages of preparing the gem. The gem\\\nwhich " ..
	"you receive from the ore will be encrusted in\\\nstone, which needs to be removed. " ..
	"This can be\\\ndone by smelting the gem in a normal furnace,\\\nwhich will return " ..
	"an uncut gem.\\\nThis new gem must be cut, with a chisel, in order\\\nto shape " ..
	"it for the ring. This is a simple enough\\\ntask, but the gems all too often " ..
	"does not survive it,\\\nand the chisel can only withstand a few uses. To\\\n" ..
	"make the chisel, a stick must be place in the\\\nbottom left corner of the grid, " ..
	"and then, an ingot of\\\nsteel must be placed in the middle. To the right\\\n" ..
	"and above that, an ingot of mithril must be placed,\\\nand this will form a" ..
	"chisel. This should then be\\\ncrafted with an uncut gem, and if your hand is" ..
	"\\\nsteady, and the structure of the gem sound, the\\\ngem will be successfully " ..
	"cut.\\\n\\\nBut even then the process is not complete, and\\\nthere remains one " ..
	"final step. The gem must be\\\npolished, and this can be done by surrounding it" ..
	"\\\nwith sand. This can expose more flaws, leading to\\\nthe gem falling apart. " ..
	"But, if everything is\\\nsuccessful, then you will have a gem which is ready\\\n" ..
	"to be combined with the ring.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nRINGS OF POWER\\\n" ..
	"----------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n" ..
	"Now, you should have a ring and a gem prepared,\\\nand ready to be combined, " ..
	"and have the new\\\nproperties added to the materials.\\\n\\\nFirst, the cut, " ..
	"polished gem must be combined with\\\nthe prepared ring in the dual furnace. " ..
	"The bond\\\nbetween the gem and the ring may fail, spoiling\\\nboth of them. " ..
	"But hopefully, the ring and the gem\\\nwill flawlessly fuse together, creating " ..
	"a united\\\nwhole, which cannot be separated.\\\n\\\nAfter the gem has been " ..
	"fused to the ring, then they\\\nmust undergo the change of properties. This " ..
	"has\\\ntwo main steps.\\\n\\\nFirst, the ring must be surrounded with rough " ..
	"rock. This must then be smelted in a very special\\\nfurnace, along with " ..
	"certain other materials. The\\\nspecial furnace is made in the following way:" ..
	"\\\nA ringsliver furnace (mentioned above) is placed in\\\nthe middle. Below, " ..
	"to the right and left of this are\\\nplaced blocks of tilkal. Directly above " ..
	"and below\\\nthe ringsilver furnace are placed blocks of mithril.\\\nAbove, " ..
	"to the right and left of it, are placed galvorn\\\nblocks, and finally, to " ..
	"each side of it are placed\\\nblocks of steel.\\\n\\\nThis complex structure " ..
	"is necessary not only to\\\nboth absorb and retain heat, but also, the " ..
	"materials\\\nthemselves contribute to the changing of the\\\nproperties " ..
	"of the rings.\\\n\\\nWhen this furnace has been built, it cannot simply" ..
	"\\\nbe placed down. Under it, you must place a three\\\nby three square of " ..
	"lava, and the furnace must rest\\\nin the middle of this, directly above the lava." ..
	"\\\n\\\nWhen the furnace has been placed, in it must be\\\nput the ring, " ..
	"surrounded in rough rock, one block\\\nof mithril, one block of tilkal and " ..
	"one block of\\\ngalvorn, along with plenty of fuel. It will take two\\\ndays " ..
	"and one night for the materials to have mixed,\\\nand the ring to be imbued " ..
	"with its power.\\\n\\\nWhen the days and night have passed, stand well\\\nback " ..
	"from the furnace. If the ring has been\\\nsuccessfully made, there will be an " ..
	"explosion\\\npowerful enough to kill nearly everything within\\\na large " ..
	"distance from the furnace, which will leave\\\na large crater, at the bottom " ..
	"of which, you will find the ring. If, however, the ring is not successfully\\\n " ..
	"made, then there will a smaller explosion, but still\\\npowerful, and the " ..
	"ring will not be formed.\\\n\\\nIf all is successful, then you will have a ring " ..
	"of\\\npower!\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nCONCLUSION\\\n" ..
	"----------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n" ..
	"The rings of power are complex things, and the\\\nprocess of making them is " ..
	"also complex. It\\\nrequires time, patience and a good quanity of\\\nresources. " ..
	"We did not discover this process at one\\\nsingle time, but rather, it took " ..
	"place over a long\\\nperiod of time, with slow steps of discovery, and\\\nmuch " ..
	"experimentation with various materials. You,\\\ntherefore, unknown reader, " ..
	"have a large\\\nadvantage over us, with the process written out, I\\\nhope " ..
	"with clarity enough so that it is easy to follow.\\\n\\\nAs a final note, " ..
	"there is only one way in which\\\nthese rings can be destroyed. They " ..
	"must be\\\nthrown into lava, after which you are advised to \\\nretreat " ..
	"a fair distance, for the death of the ring is\\\neven more explosive that " ..
	"its birth was.\\\n\\\nFarewell, and good luck to you, unknown reader!\"}"
